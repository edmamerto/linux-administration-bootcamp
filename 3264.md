With a bit we can express up to 2 values
 > 2 bits 4

> A bit can have 2 values. If there are three bits, 23 = 8. (2^n)

In the context of a processor
> the number of bits genereally refers to the amount of memory it can address so while 

> 32-bit  processor is limited to 4 gigs of memory

> 64-bit processor can handle 16 billion gigs of ram

1 GB = 1024 MB
1 MB = 1024 KB
1 KB = 1024 Bytes
